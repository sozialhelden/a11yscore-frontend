## What regions are available?

In the current version of the a11y-Score, accessibility can be calculated for the 16 federal states as well as 418 urban and rural districts in Germany. These regions are based on the so-called [administrative boundaries](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:boundary%3Dadministrative) from OpenStreetMap (OSM).

### Administrative Levels
Since every country has its own administrative structure (e.g., federal states in Germany, cantons in Switzerland, or departments in France), OSM uses a numerical scale from 2 to 10 to represent this hierarchy.
The lower the number, the larger and more superior the area.

Currently, the a11y-Score uses [administrative levels](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:admin_level) 4 to 6:

- **Level 4**: The 16 federal states, e.g., Berlin, Bavaria, North Rhine-Westphalia.
- **Level 5**: Administrative districts (Regierungsbezirke), e.g., the Freiburg district (Regierungsbezirk Freiburg). Not every federal state has these.
- **Level 6**: Rural districts (Landkreise) and urban districts (kreisfreie Städte), e.g., Segeberg district, the city of Aachen.
