## How to interpret the score?

The a11y-Score is represented by a number between 0 and 100. A higher value means better accessibility. A value of 100 means that all accessibility criteria have been completely fulfilled.

### No percentage

The value is **NOT** a percentage! A score of 50 does not mean that “half of a region is accessible” or that accessibility is “half as good” as with a score of 100. Nor does it mean that only half of all criteria are met. Instead, the value should be understood as a continuous scale.

### Data availability

Another important point is that the score also takes data availability into account. In regions where little data on accessibility is available, the score may be lower, even if the actual accessibility is better.

The score therefore improves not only through measures to improve accessibility, but also through better data collection and maintenance.
