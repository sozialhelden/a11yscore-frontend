## What does the score mean?

The a11y-Score provides a score between 0 and 100. A higher value indicates better accessibility. A value of 100 means that all recorded accessibility criteria have been completely met.

### Not a percentage

The value is **NOT** a percentage! A score of 50 does not mean that "half of a region is accessible" or that accessibility is "half as good" as a score of 100. It also doesn't mean that only half of all criteria are met. Instead, the value should be understood as a continuous scale. You can think of it like this: if people are asked to indicate their level of satisfaction on a scale of 1 to 10, a person with a value of 6 is not necessarily twice as satisfied as a person with a value of 3. But they are definitely more satisfied.

### Data Quality

The score also takes the data situation into account. In regions where there is very little accessibility data available, the score may be lower – even if the actual accessibility is better.

It is important to us to motivate the collection of accessibility data *itself*. Therefore, the score improves when new data is entered into OpenStreetMap or Wheelmap – even if that data indicates poor accessibility.

The score, therefore, does not only improve when accessibility is enhanced through concrete measures, but also when more data is collected and maintained overall.
