## What data is being used?

The a11y-Score is calculated using open data based on [OpenStreetMap (OSM)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/). OSM is a collaborative map of the world created and maintained by volunteers. It is built around the idea that every physical object on the map is described by a set of so-called _tags_. Each tag is made of a _key_ which describes the category, and a _value_ that contains the actual information. For more information on how Open Street Map works visit the [OSM Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tags). For more details on how the a11y-Score is calculated, please refer to [How is it calculated?](/faqs/how-is-it-calculated)

The following tables contain a list of the OSM tags that are used to select places and geometries for each category. Additionally, there is a list of the OSM tags that are used for the accessibility criteria.
