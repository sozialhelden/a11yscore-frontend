It describes how you can integrate OpenStreetMap data into your processes.

### Collecting data

The a11y-Score uses data from [OpenStreetMap (OSM)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) to evaluate accessibility. You can help by mapping places in your area and/or adding information about their accessibility.

### Spreading the word

Help us raise awareness for our project:

- Tell your friends, family, and colleagues about the a11y-Score.
- Encourage those around you to join in: for example, map wheelchair-accessible places together on [Wheelmap.org](https://wheelmap.org).
- Draw the attention of your city or local transport authority to [our work](https://www.sozialhelden.de/topics/digitalisierung).
- If you are reading this on GitHub, give the project a star.

Together, we can create a truly inclusive world and remove barriers on a large scale.
