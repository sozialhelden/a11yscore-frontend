## What is a11y-Score?

Whether in the city or in the countryside, buildings and paths are often full of obstacles for millions of people. This severely restricts their everyday mobility and quality of life.

A major problem that stands in the way of smart decisions for improvements is the frequent lack of a comprehensive overview and comparable data on actual accessibility.

### A new indicator for accessibility

The a11y-Score project aims to make the accessibility of the physical world measurable and comparable. It is more than just a data evaluation. Our goal is to create, for the first time, a reliable indicator that makes regions worldwide comparable in terms of their accessibility.

This project is funded by the Federal Ministry of Transport (BMV) as part of the [mFUND initiative](https://www.bmv.de/SharedDocs/DE/Artikel/DG/mfund-projekte/a11y.html). This underscores the nationwide relevance and strategic value of our approach to driving digital transformation in the field of mobility and improving participation.

_(If you're wondering what “a11y” means, it's short for “accessibility.” The “11” serves as a placeholder for eleven letters between the “a” and the ‘y’ – a little “nerd fact” from the tech world.)_

### What the project aims to achieve

#### Visibility and comparability

The a11y-Score provides a uniform value that reflects accessibility in neighborhoods, counties, or entire regions.

#### Basis for decisions

It can serve as a key performance indicator (KPI) to assess the status quo, measure progress over time, and derive targeted recommendations for action (e.g. for construction measures, data collection, campaigns).

#### True inclusion

By providing this data, we are helping to improve the participation of people with disabilities and create a man-made environment that works for everyone.
