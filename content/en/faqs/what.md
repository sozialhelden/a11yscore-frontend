## What is the a11y-Score?

Whether in the city or the countryside: buildings and pathways are full of obstacles for millions of people. This severely limits their daily lives and quality of life. That is why cities and municipalities in Germany have long been legally required to establish accessibility and inclusion.

When trying to make smart decisions and take measures to improve the situation, one often encounters a problem: there is no overview or meaningful data to determine how good or bad accessibility actually is.

### Measuring, evaluating, and comparing accessibility

This is exactly where our development project comes in: the a11y-Score is a program that measures and evaluates actual accessibility in a region, city, or municipality based on defined characteristics and categories. For the first time, this creates a way to compare the accessibility of different regions.

The name a11y-Score describes exactly that: "a11y" is a common abbreviation for "accessibility." The "11" stands for the eleven letters between the "a" and the "y." Combined with "Score" — the English word for a points-based rating or grade — it simply means "Accessibility Rating."

This project is funded by the Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport (BMDV) as part of the [mFUND initiative](https://www.bmv.de/SharedDocs/DE/Artikel/DG/mfund-projekte/a11y.html). This highlights how relevant our approach is nationwide — for modern, digital mobility and greater participation.

### What the a11y-Score offers

#### Visibility and comparability

The a11y-Score provides a unified value that reflects accessibility in neighborhoods, districts, or entire regions. It is not limited to Germany; it can potentially be used worldwide in the future.

#### A basis for decisions

The a11y-Score can serve as a Key Performance Indicator (KPI), essentially the primary metric for accessibility: it can be used to determine the current status of a region, derive targeted recommendations for action (e.g., for construction projects, data collection, public awareness campaigns), and measure and document progress over time.

#### Real inclusion

By providing this data, we contribute to improving the participation of people with disabilities and creating a human-made environment that works for everyone.
